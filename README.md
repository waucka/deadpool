# deadpool

deadpool restarts unresponsive EC2 instances.

## Setup

### AWS Credentials

You will need to run the server as an appropriately privileged user.  The privileges you need depend on the monitoring plugins you use.  See policy_template.json for an AWS policy template for an AWS policy that has the needed privileges for most cases.

## Thanks

Many thanks to my employer, [Exosite](https://exosite.com/), which gives its employees the freedom to open-source broadly useful tools like this.
